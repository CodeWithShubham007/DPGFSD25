// JavaScript is a syncronous and single-threaded language. 
// This means that code is executed line by line, and each line must finish executing before the next one begins. 
// However, JavaScript can handle asynchronous operations using mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await.

// Variable in JavaScript
// In JavaScript, variables can be declared using var, let, or const.
// var is function-scoped, while let and const are block-scoped.
// const is used for variables that should not be reassigned.

// int a = 10;
// str b = "Hello, World!";
// inilized variable
let a = 10; 
a = 20;   
var b = "Hello, World!";
var b = "You"
const c = "Thanks"
 c = "Thank"

 console.log(c);
